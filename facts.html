            <div class="factBody"><p>Navratri, when translated into English, means nine nights.
            </p><p>    
                The night is a time for relaxation and rejuvenation of the mind and the body. If we don't rest at night, it becomes difficult to carry on with our activities the next day, doesn’t it?
            </p><p>    

                Similarly, Navratri is the resting time for the spirit in you. It is the time when you withdraw yourself from all sensory activities (eating, talking, watching, touching, listening, smelling), and rest in yourself. This withdrawal from all sensory activities takes you deeper within yourself, which is the actual source of bliss, joy, and enthusiasm in your life.
            </p><p>    

                Most of us don't get to experience this because we are constantly engaged in some activity or the other. We are always engaged with the mind. Navratri is the time to withdraw from the mind and rest in the spirit or soul. It's the time to feel your soul!</p>
                <h2>
                    Connect to the Source
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are connected to this universe - to some power that makes this whole creation happen. This power is filled with love; the whole creation is filled with love. Navratri is the time for you to realize that you are loved, and rest in this feeling of love. When you do this, you come out feeling stronger, wiser, rejuvenated, refreshed and harmonious.
                </p><p>    

                    In our day-to-day lives, we get very caught up in different activities. All kinds of noises are constantly going on in our minds - bickering, arguing, and judging, and so on. Navratri is a time to overcome these tendencies and unite with the source.
